<h1>LORD GANESHA</h1>
<hr>
<p>Lord Ganesha, also known as Ganapati or Vinayaka, is one of the most revered and beloved deities in Hinduism. He is widely worshipped as the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences, and the god of beginnings. Ganesha is depicted with the head of an elephant and a human body, symbolizing wisdom, intelligence, and strength. His distinctive elephant head is believed to have been bestowed upon him by Lord Shiva, his father, after Ganesha's original head was accidentally severed by Lord Shiva's trident. Ganesha is often depicted with four arms, each carrying symbolic objects such as a rope, an axe, a modak (sweet dumpling), and his broken tusk. He is typically portrayed sitting on a throne or with his mount, a mouse. Devotees of Ganesha seek his blessings before starting any new venture or undertaking, as he is believed to pave the way for success and remove any obstacles that may arise. Ganesha's popularity extends beyond Hinduism and he is revered by people of various cultural backgrounds around the world.</p>
